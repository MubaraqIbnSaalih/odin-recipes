    <h3> What is Beef Jerky?</h3>
    <p>
        Beef jerky is lean, trimmed beef that has been cut into strips and dried. Drying (or dehydrating) meat with heat and salt slows bacterial growth dramatically, stretching its lifespan by many months. The word "jerky" comes from a Quechua word: "Ch'arki," which literally means "dry, salted meat."

        What Is Beef Jerky Made Out Of?
    </h3>
    <p>
        This beef jerky is made from steak cut into thin strips and marinated in a sweet-savory marinade made with spices, sauces, and seasonings that you probably already have on hand. Some beef jerky recipes can be made in the oven, but this one requires a food dehydrator.
