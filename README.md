# odin-recipes
    I am working on my very first project from The Odin Project curriculum 
    I will be creating a recipe website (without CSS just HTML)
###
    I created an home page consisting of links to the recipes.
    I created four recipes pages. I used allrecipes.com as my reference.
    I really enjoyed this.
